The noble idea of establishing an educational institution in the college level in Aklan offering academic courses had its inception before the last war. The inclusive months of August? October, 1941 were devoted to its organization. The outbreak of the War stalled its foundation. After the liberation, prominent men and educators in Aklan adhered and joined efforts to organize. A committee composed of seven members was constituted. The committee elected Mr. Digno Alba as Chairman. A finance committee headed by Mr. Vicente M. Salido and a committee on style to draft the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws headed by Atty. Ludovico O. Peralta were also formed. A group took charge of conducting a campaign for stockholders and students throughout Aklan. Among others, this group was composed of Mr. Digno Alba, Mr. Filemon F. Guerra, Mr. Emeterio L. Prado, Mr. Luis Enriquez, Atty. Ludovico O. Peralta, Mr. Vicente M. Salido, Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon, Mr. Manuel O. Peralta, Mr. Teodoro P. Icamina and Mr. Juan Tolentino. On August 18, 1945, in a meeting of stockholders, the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws drafted by the Peralta Committee were approved and submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, the fifteen incorporators and the members of the Board of Trustees were elected. The fifteen incorporators elected according to the number of votes cast were: Dean Filemon G. Guerra, Atty. Manuel Laserna, Atty. Raz Me?ez, Atty. Ludovico O. Peralta, Dr. Federico R. Me?ez, Mr. Digno Alba, Prof. Vicente M. Salido, Prof. Emeterio L. Prado, Atty. Jose A. Urquiola, Prof. Jose M.
