<h3 class="text-primary">Our History</h3>
<br>
<p class="text-left mx-5 text-secondary">
The noble idea of establishing an educational institution in the college level in Aklan offering academic courses had its
inception before the last war. The inclusive months of August? October, 1941 were devoted to its organization.
The outbreak of the War stalled its foundation. After the liberation, prominent men and educators in Aklan adhered and joined
efforts to organize. A committee composed of seven members was constituted. The committee elected Mr. Digno Alba as Chairman.
A finance committee headed by Mr. Vicente M. Salido and a committee on style to draft the Articles of Incorporation and By-laws headed by Atty.
Ludovico O. Peralta were also formed. A group took charge of conducting a campaign for stockholders and students throughout Aklan.
Among others, this group was composed of Mr. Digno Alba, Mr. Filemon F. Guerra, Mr. Emeterio L. Prado, Mr. Luis Enriquez,
Atty. Ludovico O. Peralta, Mr. Vicente M. Salido, Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon, Mr. Manuel O. Peralta, Mr. Teodoro P. Icamina and Mr. Juan Tolentino.
On August 18, 1945, in a meeting of stockholders, the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws drafted by the Peralta Committee were approved and
submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, the fifteen incorporators and the members of the Board of Trustees were elected.
The fifteen incorporators elected according to the number of votes cast were: Dean Filemon G. Guerra, Atty. Manuel Laserna, Atty. Raz Me?ez,
Atty. Ludovico O. Peralta, Dr. Federico R. Me?ez, Mr. Digno Alba, Prof. Vicente M. Salido, Prof. Emeterio L. Prado, Atty. Jose A. Urquiola,
Prof. Jose M. Reyes, Dr. Querubin Fulgencio, Mr. Jesus Aranas, Dr. Salvador R. Acevedo, Dr. Rafael S. Tumbokon and Dr. Conrado F. Quimpo.

<h3 class="text-primary">COLLEGE OPENING</h3>

<p class="text-left mx-5 text-secondary">
Mr. Filemon F. Guerra was the first Dean at the opening of Aklan College. He organized a strong faculty of mostly M.A. degree holders.
On July 9, 1945, classes in the Aklan College formally opened with 180 students? 90 in the collegiate department and 90 pupils in the elementary grades.

<br>
<br>
The Aklan College occupied the concrete building owned by Mr. Vicente Salas Reyes located at the corner of Plaridel (now Pastrana) and 19 Martyrs Streets.
In June 1948, the college moved to its present site, also called Main Campus.
<br>
<br>

Courses offered in the collegiate department ranged from the Two-Year Normal, leading to Elementary Teachers Certificate (E.T.C.), Two-General Preparatory,
leading to the degree of Associate in Arts (A.A) to the complete courses in Education and Liberal Arts, leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Education (B.S.E.),
Bachelor of Science in Home Economics (B.S.H.E), Bachelor of Arts (A.B.), Bachelor of Science (B.S.) and Bachelor of Philosophy (Ph.B.), respectively.
</p>
<br>
<hr class="mx-5">


<br>
<br>
<h3 class="text-primary">GOVERNMENT RECOGNITION</h3>

<p class="text-left mx-5 text-secondary">

The first certificate of recognition was granted to the College on July 1, 1947, and personally brought by Bishop Jose Ma. Cuenco to Kalibo on October 2, 1947.
The date was an occasion of rejoicing in the college.
</p>
<br>
<hr class="mx-5">

<br>
<br>
<h3 class="text-primary">FIRST GRADUATE</h3>

<p class="text-left mx-5 text-secondary">
Of the 90 students who enrolled in the collegiate department in the first year of Aklan College, 35 students graduated in the year 1947 from the Normal
Department and from the Liberal Arts Department with the title of E.T.C. and A.A., respectively.

<br>
<br>
<h3 class="text-primary">BISHOP CUENCO AND CARDINAL SIN: PATRON AND BENEFACTOR</h3>

<p class="text-left mx-5 text-secondary">
Like many other organizations, the College was never an exemption to financial trials. It was in the second year of its existence that the College suffered
financial difficulties for its expansion so that it had to seek the aid of the Catholic Church through the Bishop of Jaro, His Excellency, Most Rev. Jose Ma. Cuenco.
Upon invitation of Mr. Digno Alba and Rt. Rev. Msgr. Jose Ituralde, the bishop as representative of the Church, joined the College with no less than P85,000 investment to acquire books,
equipment and apparatus, to reconstruct the college building, to construct ROTC Armory and Home Economics Building, and to pay the salaries of the faculty.
It was with the joining of the bishop and some of the clergy as members of administration and faculty that Aklan College was converted to becoming a Catholic institution
where religious instruction had been integrated in the curricula. Thus, Aklan College begot the dangling phrase in its name?a Catholic institution?. With his deep interest to the advocacy
of Catholic education in his diocese, His Excellency, Most Rev. Jose Ma. Cuenco was regarded as the Patron of Aklan College as a Catholic institution. Moreover, the father of the good bishop was also an Aklanon.
<br>
<br>

Another part of the beautiful historical vignette of the College unknown to many alumni, students, teachers and even stockholders was His Eminence Jaime Cardinal Sin?s crucial role
in the transfer of governance of then Aklan College and now Aklan Catholic College from the Diocese of Jaro to the Diocese of Capiz and eventually to Kalibo. Little was it known that
the Diocese of Jaro owned majority stocks of the corporation. In his enabling persuasion, Cardinal Sin captured the gracious will of Bishop Cuenco to donate all shares and holdings
with the College under the proviso that if Aklan become a diocese, the same should be given to it. The cardinal then was named the eminent benefactor of the College.

<h3 class="text-primary">COLLEGE OF LAW AND ENGINEERING AND THE GRADUATE SCHOOL</h3>

<p class="text-left mx-5 text-secondary">
Aklan College is the first higher education institution in Aklan to offer law and graduate school courses. Anticipating the need for a college of law in the province,
Aklan College offered a Bachelor of Law course in 1958 but it was closed in 1972. Early in 1992, the College of Law was revived.<br>
<br>
<br>

In 1969, Aklan College offered engineering programs as the answer to the demand of the people of Aklan. The College administration set up a separate engineering building situated
at Andagao, Kalibo. In 2004, the department and programs were closed to cater to the timely demands on relevant programs for the new breed.
<br>
<br>

Back in 1964, the graduate school was established. Since then, the graduate school has been providing teachers of both public and private institutions the needed graduate education or Master?s degree.
<br>
<br>


During the administration of Msgr. Adolfo P. Depra, the Graduate Education Programs were also expanded by having consortium with the University of San Agustin for the Masters in Business Administration (MBA)
and Master of Arts in Education (M.A.Ed.), major in English. The Central Philippine University (CPU) has also tied up with the College to offer M.A.Ed. in Mathematics and the Doctor of Education (Ed.D.)
as extension programs with the College. These consortia have been the first of its kind in the province of Aklan.

of an annual called the Acorn (now Acian) and subsequently named The Aklan Collegian (now the official publication of the college department). Eventually, institutionalizing co-academic organizations in English, Mathematics,
Sciences, Social Sciences, and other departmental entities were encouraged to foster students? Participation in curriculum designs and programs.

<h3 class="text-primary">THE FATHER RECTORS</h3>

<p class="text-left mx-5 text-secondary">
S.V.D. Father Eugene Stoll and Luis Creder were the two foreign Rectors of Aklan College. On April 12, 1954 and at a time of economic difficulties and financial hardships of the Filipino people, Rt. Msgr. Salvador M. Mabasa assumed the rectorship.

for the expansion of Aklan College, Msgr. Mabasa began the phase-by-phase development of the college with the help of the student organizations, alumni, and faculty in 1954. On April 3, 1956, a new high school building was constructed under the
Mabasa administration; a prominent three-storey building facing the Kalibo Municipal Park was constructed. Along with that was the construction of the ACC Gym-auditorium, purchase of laboratory apparatus and cementing of the quadrangle and ground.
Eventually, a lot was acquired in Andagao where an engineering building was erected. In his lifetime, Msgr. Mabasa never tired himself of analyzing and synthesizing the problems of the college vis-?-vis economic conditions. Well-meaning persons,
alumni and former faculty members refered to him fondly as the rector-architect of Aklan College development.
<br>
<br>

When Msgr. Mabasa died, he was succeeded by Msgr. Jose S. Salido. Msgr. Salido?s stint as a rector was short-lived, since he died a year after his assumption to rectorship. Yet, he played a major role in shaping the development of Aklan College as Treasurer for twenty years.
